    <h1>Difference Between Body Selector and Universal Selector</h1>
<h1>Body Selector:</h1>
<p>Applies style properties to body element.<br>
Elements within body may inherit the property values. Some properties default to 'inherit'.<br>
Style declarations that match an element within body can override the inherited style.</p>
<br>
<h1>The Universal Selector * (all elements):</h1>
<p>Applies style properties to all individual elements.<br>
Replaces inherited style properties, and default 'initial values'. Blocks inheritance.<br>
Other, more specific css selectors that match an element will replace the style properties applied by *.</p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>Use body for style properties that default to inherit, such as font, color, in order to provide a sensible default value for elements,<br>
reducing the need to explicitly code for every case, and preserving the ability for elements contained at lower levels below body<br> to inherit from their parents.
Probably better not to use the Universal Selector * in this case.It interrupts inheritance between<br> 
other elements within body, and may force you to write more css rules to compensate. It can be a factor in slowing rendering of pages.<br>
 This depends on the size and content of the page and how many css rules there are.</p>
