   <h1>What Is Natu Kodi Kura?</h1>
<p><font style="color: black">Natu Kodi Kura</font> is a popular country chicken curry recipe that is part of Andhra cuisine. Natu Kodi,<br>
meaning country chicken is a rich gravy made with different spices. The typical village-style recipe is<br>
cooked on a wood fire in mud pots. All the ingredients are mixed and slow-cooked to perfection for a<br> delicious, smoky flavour.</p>
<br>
<br>
<font style="color: black;">Natu Kodi</font> is enjoyed with minapa garelu, also known as medu vada. However, you can also have it with<br>
rice or roti as well. For that authentic taste, it's important to use country chicken and not broiler<br> chicken. For this recipe, you can
 choose to cut the chicken either into small pieces or larger-sized<br> pieces.
